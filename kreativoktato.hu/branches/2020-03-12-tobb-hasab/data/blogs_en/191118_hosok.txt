Theater in education
<p>Heroes of education are probably teachers who stand in front of a
class day by day and attempt to transfer their knowledge to their
students in an understandable, creative and interesting way. Teachers
who stand up every morning with the aim of raising the attention of
their students and of brining the most out of all students. Teachers
who are not only educators but also trainers.</p>
<p>However, there are other heroes at schools. We could not imagine
how many! Who are they? They can be famous historical or literature
people (all Readers must have thought of them), but heroes can be
grammar concepts, mathematical terms, institutions, organizations –
anything, only our phantasy limits it. How can they be heroes? We
only need to bring theatre into education.</p>

<p>How can we identify heroes in literature? How can we know that a
person is a hero? Heroes have three characteristics: (1) main quality
(identity); (2) aim; and (3) obstacles hindering them to achieve their
aim. Just take Robert Langdon as an example (the hero in the Da Vinci
code; Angels and Demons; Inferno and Origin). His main quality (1) is
that he is a scientist of symbols. His aim (2) is to discover secrets,
and the obstacles standing in front of achieving the aim (3) are the
religious regulations.</p>
<p>This logic can be simply fitted to education, and we can use it in
any subject and any course. Maybe we assume that only alive persons
can be heroes, or animals or plants. However, this is not true! We can
visualize this method in the example of addition. So, our hero is
Addition (we assume it is a male). His main quality (1) is “being
always more”, his main aim (2) is the continuous increase, and its
obstacle (3) is subtraction. In our classes, we can give the task to
our students to define a learned concept as a hero. We will be
extremely surprised how many ideas the students will have!</p>
<p>What are the main advantages of this creative method?</p>
<ol>
<li>It requires creativity from the teachers and the students,
both.</li>
<li>It is easy to memorize because of its uniqueness.</li>
<li>It is a simple and creative way to test how much a student
understands the relations.</li>
<li>It is easy to adapt to all subjects and courses.</li>
</ol>
<p>I have learned about this method in the
_HREF(`https://www.trainingcentre.gr/training-courses/39-innovative-teaching-methods',`Innovative
teaching methods') training organized by the IDEC.</p>
