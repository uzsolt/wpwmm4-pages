the academic, government and international business sectors. She

<p>Gloria started her career as a teacher, right after her
secondary education, when she was assigned the task of
identifying, developing and honing the talents of young people at
both primary and junior school levels in the remotest parts of
southern Ghana. At that stage, she taught Mathematics, Technical
Skills and Integrated Science with an amazing result. This
success led her to be officially employed as a Pupil Teacher by
the Ghana Education Service (the official institution in charge
of education in Ghana). She also worked for the Ghana Statistical
Service and Nestlé. With a desire to become an astute
International Business Consultant, with emphasis on development
and behavioral economics, she enrolled in the MSc program in
International Economy & Business (INEB) at the University of
Szeged, Hungary: a program she is billed to complete in July
2020. She is currently working on thesis topic pivoted around
Global Citizenship Education among the youth on topics related to
poverty and extremism. She hopes that the outcome of this project
would form the foundation of creative teaching towards the
building of the good generation.</p>
