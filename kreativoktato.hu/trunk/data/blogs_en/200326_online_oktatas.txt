Blog Entry about teaching online 
<p>How do I feel today? Well, I feel quite strange, but I am
also very excited. Today, I’m going to have my first ever
livestreamed Market Research class. I’ve been thinking about
it all morning and I realized that there is a life lesson I
have to learn: at the beginning of the semester, I politely,
but kind of strictly asked my students never to write to me
on Facebook or Instagram, as they are not the appropriate
platforms for communicating. And as you see, now we are
approaching the end of March and I am teaching them via
Instagram. This is how much our world has changed in a
matter of months.</p>
<p>I believe that this current situation teaches us many
things. We cannot take everything for granted. If something
was a very strict rule yesterday, it can easily turn into an
irrelevant and minor issue today. For me, the most important
thing is to transfer the knowledge I would have transferred
in the classroom online to at least the same quality as it
would have happened in person.</p>
<p>The world has taken a 180 turn for me too. When I receive
an Instagram message from my students (and I do receive
them, more than one a day), I feel happy, but at the same
time I also start thinking about whether I should have
adapted to online platforms earlier.</p>
<p>Several hours later...</p>
<p>Now I can say that I have held my first online Instagram
live session both in English and in Hungarian. A quick
summary of the Hungarian event:</p>
_UL(
`I have 99 Hungarian students signed up for my course on
Neptun',
`I have 81 followers (as of 26 March 2020) on the Insta
account dedicated to teaching purposes (minus 3-4
colleagues, who follow me too)',
`My live was viewed by 71 people (both live and recorded
video views included)',
`In average, 50 people were watching the live session'
)
<p>Personally, I extremely enjoyed the live. I could of
course record videos here at home without being live, I
could also record my voice while I am showing only the
PowerPoint. But I think that would not reach the desired
effect, and most of all, I would not enjoy it so much, as I
did today.</p>
<p>One enormous advantage of Instagram Lives is that if I
ask a question, students can react, and they do react. It
was great that I could see them (at least their numbers)
there and it was great that I was not talking to the empty
room.</p>
<p>All in all, it was a great experience for me. I’ll
definitely continue this semester via Instagram lives. Now I
am off to edit my videos and upload them to IGTV.</p>
