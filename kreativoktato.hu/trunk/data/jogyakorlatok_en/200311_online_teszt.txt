Online tests – Which one shall I use?
Bea Udvari

<p>One of the biggest classroom challenges in the XXI. century is:
shall we use and allow the use of smart devices in our lessons in the
classroom? The following questions have arisen in most of us: should
the students use their smart devices during the lessons? If yes, when?
And what would be the suitable extent? Which tasks should we do with
them? Or shall I completely prohibit the use of smart devices in the
classroom? How can I do this? If I prohibit, isn’t it harmful? Can I
only keep the attention through smart devices?</p>
<p>These are eternal
dilemmas, which we have already discussed in
_HREF(`/blog/191010_tariannamaria.html',this blog post).</p>
<p>Now, in
this post, we are going to show some free, online platforms, which
enables us to use smart devices in the classroom. This gamification
can be used to test the students’ knowledge, and we can also reach
those students who cannot be open in face-to-face interactions. The
online pages have been tested based on our experience and with the
same questionnaire. These tests are also published, so you can test
their functions and working on your own.</p>
