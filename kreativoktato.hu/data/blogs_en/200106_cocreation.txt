Co-creation
<p>The concept of co-creation first appeared in the business world as
companies realized that their customers’ needs are constantly changing. The
companies cannot sell products or services to the new generations without
fully investigating their needs. Therefore, they concluded that in order
for them to be able to make further profit, they should ask their consumers
of what they want to buy.</p>
<p>You must have heard of Starbucks and IKEA (two international companies)
before. What is common in them? Both of them apply the method of
co-creation. Let’s see what co-creation in real life is. Let’s start with
Starbucks and two widely-known facts:</p>
<ol>
<li>One of the most popular signature drinks of Starbucks is Pumpkin Spice
Latte, which is a latte with the flavor of a pumpkin.</li>
<li>WIFI and internet is always complimentary at Starbucks.</li>
</ol>
<p>Both of these factors can be considered successful marketing tools, as
everyone knows those people sitting in Starbucks with their laptops and
drinks (most of the time they are businessmen or businesswomen or students)
working extremely hard. But whose idea was Pumpkin Spice Latte and free
Wi-Fi? It wasn't the ideas of Starbucks, but their customers, which is
called co-creation. (If you also happen to have a great idea, you’ll just
have to go to the _HREF(`https://ideas.starbucks.com/',`homepage of
Starbucks ideas') and send in your ideas
voluntarily. Starbucks then decides whether the idea is feasible enough to
carry out.)</p>

<p>Let’s look at our second example which is IKEA. It is well know that
furniture made by IKEA have to be assembled by consumers, which is already
a certain form of co-creation. But IKEA went even further. If you go
online, you can design (not only assemble) your own furniture that IKEA
will produce for you. After delivery, you can assemble it yourself. This is
also called co-creation.</p>
<p>If now we understand co-creation in the business world well, then let’s
see what it means in education. Similarly to Starbucks and IKEA, we also
ask the opinion of consumers of education, namely the students, about what
they would like to consume or in other words, learn. Based on the
literature, we can differentiate between the co-creation of curriculum,
co-creation of course design and course tasks. The level of co-creation
depends on the willingness, devotion and skills of the co-creators.</p>
<p>Why is co-creation important in education? The younger and younger
students in education have been born into the technological world and are
surrounded with internet. Research proved that they are unable to
concentrate on certain things for a long period of time. Let’s just imagine
how would they be able to sit and listen to 90 minutes straight (which is
the length of a university lecture), if they cannot even pay attention to a
20-minute video. This dilemma could be resolved by co-creation, which
method aims at students taking part in the creation of the curriculum, what
and how exactly they learn. This way, students would be able to learn by
doing and experience.</p>
