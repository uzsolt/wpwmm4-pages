The global challenges were caused by us with our own behavior.
<p>With Ildikó Pusztai-Varga we participated in the annual conference
and exhibition of EAIE (European Association of International
Education) in Helsinki, September 2019. Finland is the second home for
Ildikó owing to her studies and the adventurous months she spent here;
besides the weird experience that we had to put on winter coat in the
Finnish autumn, we arrived home with inspiring experiences. In the
interactive sessions, we could learn about how to handle the
challenges of teaching in English as a mean of instruction. I could
participate in the best conference of my life!</p>
<p>Besides teaching methodologies, both of us – and the other 6,000
participants of the conference – were inspired by the opening plenary
session and the keynote speaker.
<a href="https://www.eaie.org/blog/simon-anholt-good-generation.html">Simon Anholt</a>
was speaking about the
necessity of change and making a change. Why was this keynote speech
so inspiring for us? Simon Anholt had a very impressive presentation:
within 25 minutes he could talk to us in a way what all participants
could feel the responsibility and all of us wanted to do something
immediately. In the 21st century, we have to face several global
challenges (poverty, inequality, climate change, child mortality,
etc.), and the national problems have become global issues. Even
though the problems have become globalized, the solutions have not,
yet. Simon Anholt emphasized that we need to face two issues: the
behavior of the countries; and the behavior of people. The countries
and their leaders need to recognize that instead of clear competition,
competition mixed with collaboration would be much more effective.
Maybe the most significant sentence of his presentation – that has
been occurring to me every day since then – was:</p>
<em>The global challenges were caused by us with our own
behavior.</em>
<p>As a result, education plays a crucial role in solving global
challenges. As Simon Anholt mentioned: “The way we bring up our
children determines tomorrow’s world”. Children can still be raised
and disciplined, so our (the adults’) responsibility is to bring up a
generation that is capable of facing global challenges instead of
running away. Simon Anholt announced his good generation project with
this keynote speech. Simon Anholt’s presentation is totally in line
with the aims of EKO that we as members are really committed to. With
Ildikó we felt as if Simon Anholt had been the spokesman of EKO. Thank
you for this experience! We deeply recommend for everybody to watch
<a href="https://www.eaie.org/blog/simon-anholt-good-generation.html">the
presentation</a>: this 25 minutes will be an unforgettable
experience.</p>
