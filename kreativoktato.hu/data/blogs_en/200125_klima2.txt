The pedantic European Union
<p>The European Union is also a great emitter, its emission was 3rd
biggest in 2018, but we have to recognize that the EU highly accomlish
in the field of mitigation of climate change. This statement is
somewhat contradictory but I hope it will be clear to the end of the
post, how can I claim this.</p>

<h3>Development of the policy</h3>
<p>You could know the  system of the European Union from history or
geography lesson. Generally, there is simply few words about
environmental policy, but it is not a recent one. The Union felt the
need of the common environmental policy already in 1972. But it was
raised to political level only by the Maastricht Treaty in 1992.</p>

<h3>Action programmes</h3>
<p>Action programmes are plans include goals and  necessary steps. The
first one is launched in 1973 and the current one is the 7th, which is
called <em>Living well, within the limits of our planet</em>.</p>

<h3>The emission trading system of the EU</h3>
<p>The Cap-and-Trade system is already mentioned in previous posts.
This system is based on the Kyoto Protocol. Factories can trade their
emission in this system. If factory „A” exceeds its emission ceiling,
it can buy the unused emission of factory „B”.</p>

<h3>A Clean Planet for All</h3>
<p>Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission set
a target to the EU to achieve 100% emission reduction for the year
2050 compare to 1990. This is based ont he long-term strategy, a Clean
Planet for All. This doesn’t mean reducing emission to 0, but being
able to absorb the gas, which would be emitted (e.g. through
afforestatoin).</p>

<h3>The Arctic region – new EU policy agenda</h3>
<p>Recognizing that the area is more exposed to the effects of climate
change (and, of course, in some exchange for influence, but it is just
politics) the Union supports researches and innovative investments,
which contribute the sustainable development in the Arctic. And also
cooperates with international forums such as the United Nations or teh
Nordic Council.</p>

<h3>Europe 2020 strategy</h3>
<p>The strategy includes three environmental objectives: to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions by at least 20%, to increase the share of
renewable energy by 20%, and to increase energy efficiency by 20%. The
first of these is achieved, the other two approach the target
value.</p>
<p>But how can it be achieved by the EU? As it isn’t a state, so its
expenditures don’t consist the those items, which are found in states’
budget. While countries spend on education, health, military,
diplomacy, etc., the Union’s budget lacks of it. In this way the Union
can expend its own budget to other expenditures, for example to
incrase its competitiveness, create cohesion, or even environmental
sustainability. Of course, it is required that the EU doesn’t want to
behave like a state. Because the primal goal of states is to gain more
power than others (let’s bot assume that this was the case only in
wartime). The simpliest way of it is to build a strong economy, which
costs a lot of money. So it is obvious that because of these two cause
(among others) a state will spend less for environment. In the current
political situation it seems like an insoluble conflict.</p>
