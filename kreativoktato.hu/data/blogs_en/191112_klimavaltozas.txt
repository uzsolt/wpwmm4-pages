The big fact-finding post
<p>As a regular university student I also chose my thesis topic few
days before the deadline. My motivacion were the following: this is an
actual challange, surely there will be plenty of resources for it and
I just had a course on it, so this thesis will be done with little
energy... Not the best recipe, do not follow my example!</p>
<p>But joking aside, I have been researching climate change for a year
now. During writing my thesis I had an increasing interest for this
topic. And of course, as I knew more, I began to worry more and more
about what would happen to us?</p>

<p>The purpose of this post is to clarify the basic concepts that I will
refer to in future posts. But kep calm, there will be no scientific or
incomprehensible thesis!</p>
<h3>Climate change</h3>
<p>It has been a natural process since the beginning of Earth's
history. The reason is the permanent change in the atmospheric
composition of the planet. It is also happening right now, expect that
humans (we are) pile it on, so getting warmer very fast.</p>
<h3>Greenhouse gases (GHG)</h3>
<p>There are six such gases in the atmosphere (the most important ones
are: CO<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub>) that prevent some of the sun's rays from being
reflected back into space. Without it, the average temperature of our
planet would be around -18 ° C. (This would be very unpleasant for the
wildlife…)</p>
<h3>Kyoto Protocol</h3>
<p>It is the first and one of the most important UN documents on
combating climate change. In a nutshell, each country has a GHG
emission cap that, if exceeded, can buy free capacity or pay a
penalty. If it makes the right decision, this is a real win-win
situation.</p>
<h3>Cap-and-Trade system</h3>
<p>After the fashion of Kyoto Protocol the European Union has created
a trading system with the same essence, just not between countries but
between factories.</p>
<h3>Paris Agreement</h3>
<p>Another key UN document in this area. Its essence is to stabilize
the Earth's average temperature at a maximum of 2°C. The participating
countries made commitments to keep it.</p>
<h3>IPCC</h3>
<p>This organization makes reports on climate change. In 2007 IPCC
even received the Nobel Peace Prize. What the organization predicts is
likely to occur.</p>
