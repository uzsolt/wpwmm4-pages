China or how can a country alone ruin the world?
<p>In the _HREF(`191112_klimavaltozas.html',`previous post')
I have already explained how I started to deal
with climate change. Currently, I deal with the actions, behaviors,
and motivations of the largest emittors under the New National
Excellence Program. China is the first as the world's largest
greenhouse gas emitter.</p>

<p>Let's look at how China is contributing to the disaster (or even
solving it):</p>
<h3>1. The largest greenhouse gas emitter</h3>
<p>In 2017, it accounted for 27% of the world's CO2 emissions, with
its 9839 Mt, taking the first place with it. In the second quarter of
2019, that number was already 10,898 Mt but where is the New Year?</p>
<h3>2. One Belt, One Road</h3>
<p>In 2013, the Chinese government announced the New Silk Road project
to make it easy for goods to reach major trading partners. The
downside of it is that it costs a lot of greenhouse gas to build
infrastructure, ports, railways, airports.</p>
<h3>3. Trade war with the United States</h3>
<p>Not China is the only one, who can destruct the world. The U.S. is
also taking its share. In such a situation, it is natural for
governments to insist on maintaining jobs, living standards and a
stable economy rather than achieving climate goals. The question is,
which one would be better in the long run?</p>
<h3>4. Cap-and-trade system based on EU model</h3>
<p>After these, let’s come a little progress. This system has been
working well in the Eurpoean Union for a long time, so it offered to
help China build one in the country as well. This "small" aid will
cost 10 million EUR.</p>
<h3>5. National Plan for Tackling Climate Change and Blue Sky Defense
Plan</h3>
<p>The government itself is trying to contribute to reducing emission.
One of these plans is to reduce emissions and the other to improve air
quality. Come on China! &#9786;</p>
<h3>6. Commitments in the Paris Agreement</h3>
<p>China has committed to peak its emissions by 2030 and then try to
reduce it. However, the numbers show different… Under these measures,
the temperature will not be 2 but 4-5 ° C, even if other countries
remain within this range. (First of all, they won't do it either.)</p>
