<p>Annamária Tari is one of the most well-known psychologists in
Hungary. She deals with the young (Y and Z) generations. Annamária
Tari delivered a presentation at the end of September 2019 in Szeged –
which was about the press (and stress) of youngsters. We could listen
to unbelievable data and facts about the X, Y and Z (and sometimes the
Alfa) generations, and about their relations to smart tools. For me,
the following 4 facts were extremely weird and made me think:</p>
<h3>#1 Users of smart tools</h3>
<p>It is unbelievable for me how fast the world of smart phones and
smart tools develops and that they are available for everybody.
According to some statistics, one fourth of the 4-year-old children
are active users of smart tools. I had to ask myself whether my
4-year-old daughter is lagging behind since she does not have a smart
phone.</p>
<h3>#2 World ache</h3>
<p>or me it is also unbelievable that it is a habit (fashion?) among
teenagers to share sad posts full of world ache. However, it should
not be so surprising since this approach to the world systematically
appears: the age of spleen was in poetry in the 1700-1800s, and since
1998 emo is a trend in music and clothes. For the members of the Z
generation, the world is equal to the Internet and the available
posts. Therefore, they are not incidentally in stress about how many
people like them or their photos and whether they meet the
expectations of others. They fight for likes.</p>
<h3>#3 Acceptable time to react</h3>
<p>For me it was unbelievable how fast the world is and everybody
wants everything immediately, but really immediately: we would like to
solve everything within a few seconds. If there is no response to –
for instance – a love message, the sender is going to be in stress
supposing that they are surely not loved, that’s why they do not
receive any response.</p>
<h3>#4 Importance of education</h3>
<p>Researchers have a scientific discourse on whether teaching is
still necessary or not, since everything can be easily found on the
internet. If information is available, why learn it? What is the task
of a school and a teacher currently? (<em>This is only valid if we are
aware of what and how to look for it...</em>)</p>
<p>I – as a member of generation Y – was brought up in the development
of the computer science and Internet, so I was really shocked what
issues are (may be) waiting for my daughters… And for us, parents,
teachers, all these raise several dilemmas how to bring up a
child.</p>
<p>If you have the chance, I recommend you to listen to Annamária Tari
in person, too.</p>
